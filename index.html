	<p>The term is used in three main ways in music, though all three are interrelated.
	The first is what is otherwise called 'rudiments', currently taught as the elements 
	of notation, of key signatures, of time signatures, of rhythmic notation, and so on.
	Theory in this sense is treated as the necessary preliminary to the study of harmony,
	counterpoint, and form. The second is the study of writings about music from ancient
	times onwards. [...] The third is an area of current musicological study that seeks
	to define processes and general principles in music â€” a sphere of research that can 
	be distinguished from analysis in that it takes as its starting-point not the 
	individual work or performance but the fundamental materials from which it is built."</p>
		
	<p>Music theory is frequently concerned with describing how musicians and composers
	make music, including tuning systems and composition methods among other topics.</p>
	
	<p>In traditional music theory, harmony is the dominant parameter of music. There is 
	no standard theory of melody or timbre. Rhythm, however, has been theoretized widely. 
	This site will discuss, for example, the concepts of beat unit, metre, and tuplet, 
	which we hope will open up some of the complexities of notation.</p>
